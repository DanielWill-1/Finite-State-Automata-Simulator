#  Finite State Automata Simulator

A visual and interactive **Finite State Automata (FSA) Simulator** built for educational and experimental purposes. It allows users to simulate both **Deterministic Finite Automata (DFA)** and **Non-deterministic Finite Automata (NFA)** with step-by-step visualization of transitions using **Graphviz**.

---

##  Overview

The simulator is designed to help users understand how DFA and NFA behave by visually tracing input strings through a given state machine.

Key components include:
- DFA/NFA distinction and logic
- Graph-based visualization of states and transitions
- Input evaluation with success/failure paths
